/**
 * Self Study 1 – TDD Coding Kata “Help ALF“
 * 
 * Late last night in the Tanner household, ALF was repairing his spaceship so he might get back to Melmac. 
 * Unfortunately for him, he forgot to put on the parking brake, and the spaceship took off during repair. 
 * Now it's hovering in space. ALF has the technology to bring the spaceship home if he can lock on to its location.
 * 
 * The map will be given in the form of a string with \n separating new lines. 
 * The bottom left of the map is [0, 0]. X is ALF's spaceship.
 * 
 * In this example:
 * findSpaceship(map) => [7, 2]
 * If you cannot find the spaceship, the result should be "Spaceship lost forever."
